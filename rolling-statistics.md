# Rolling Statistics

Rolling, e.g. moving average, means - we create a sliding window, e.g. 20 days, and calculate mean for each window separatelly.

## What statistic to use in order to find when to buy stocks?

We need to find the biggest value from the mean. So, it is rolling standard deviation.

Add two more STD moved by some number. When the data crosses one of those curves, we should think about sale or buy.
