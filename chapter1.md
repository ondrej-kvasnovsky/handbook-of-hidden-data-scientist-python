# CSV with pandas

We are going to explore [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org) library in this chapter. Pandas is an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.

I was really impressed by this library. We can easily load multiple CSV files, join them together and then perform another operation. It almost feel you have your CSV loaded in database that you can operate using Python code.
