# Python

Ok, THIS is NOT easy. I am developer who grow up on Java. Then I enjoied Groovy a lot. I also programmed in other languages like JavaScript, C, C++, Basic, C\#, TCL/TK, R or Swift recently.

When I saw Python first time, I said to myself "this is not for me, it looks old and odd".  I took few courses on Coursera and Udacity. It did not change my mind about Python as a language.

What change my mind, are lessons about Machine Learning. When it comes to mathematical operations, like working with n-dimensional arrays, matrices or doing statistical calculations, Python blew my mind. It is so powefull and fast. I stoped learning R language because it has a lot of production limitations. But Python, it seems Python does not suffer with performance issues like R.

So, now I take Python as really beautiful library to work with when it comes to working with data.

Python libraries wrap C or Fortran code in many cases. That makes your code run super fast. And, that is what I love a lot \(even though the language looks pretty old-school\).

Then I asked question "Is Python slower than Java?". Here is the answer: [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/672857/is-python-slower-than-java-c](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/672857/is-python-slower-than-java-c). What you find after reading all that stuff, Java might be faster. BUT, try to write all the functionality that is provided by Python libraries in Java. You might not like that talkative coding at all.
