# Supervised Learning

In supervised learning, you have bunch of examples and you know the answers. Then it mimic or learn what is expected. For example, if you drive a car which has ability to learn from you, the car will observe your driving style. When we would provide these data to supervise learning, the car could be taught your style of driving and could even drive instead of you.
