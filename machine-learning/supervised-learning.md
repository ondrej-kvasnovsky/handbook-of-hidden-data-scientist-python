# Supervised Learning

In supervised learning, you have bunch of examples and you know the answers. Then the machine learning algorithms can mimic or learn what is expected. For example, if you drive a car which has ability to learn from you, the car will observe your driving style. When we would provide these data to supervise learning algorithms, the car could be taught your style of driving and could even drive instead of you \(in case you like your style of driving and would like other people to drive like you\).

There are two terms that should be understood before going deeper into algorithms. It is **features** and **labels**.

Features of music could be: intensity, tempo, genre, gender, rhythm and so on. Look at this example. Features are expressed on axes and labels are the answers based on the coordinates of features. In this example, features are numerical values of intensity and tempo. Labels are classification of data points in the chart. Int his case, we have two labels, "She likes those" and "She doesn't like".

Here is another example with two features, bumpiness and slope. Labels, in this example, are the colors blue, red and green.
