# Decision Trees

This is very popular algorithm in supervised machine learning.

## Linearly separable data

Are these data points linearly separable? They are not, which could suggest that decision trees are good for data sets that are not linearly separable.

If we set a good thresholds for wind and sun features, we could separate the data into 3 segments. The decision tree can be then created. See the following image.

This is what decision tree algorithm is doing for us. It finds these thresholds for us and creates the decision tree based on that.

Here is one more example which is using more realistic approach.
